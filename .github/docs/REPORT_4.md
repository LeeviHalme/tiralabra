# Week 4

This week I implemented a Tokenizer class to parse the input string into tokens. This allows more complex expressions to be evaluated and enables the parsing of for example negative numbers. I also added a new test for the tokenizer and refactored the shunting yard algorithm to use the tokenizer.

I also added a new test for the shunting yard algorithm. The algorithm is now able to handle more complex expressions and is able to parse negative numbers.

I also made sure that the algorithm works as intended and is ready for the first peer review.

Next week I will start implementing the postfix evaluation algorithm and add tests for it since this week all the time available went into building the tokenizer.

Time spent: Approximately 7 hours
