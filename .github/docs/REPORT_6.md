# Week 6

This week, I focused on implementing the RPN Evaluator class, which is a crucial component for evaluating expressions parsed by the Shunting Yard algorithm. The class provides a method to evaluate a Queue of tokens. It can handle all basic operators. I also wrote basic and advanced tests for the RPN Evaluator class. The basic tests cover the basic operators, while the advanced tests cover more complex situations that should throw errors. I also made the CLI prettier by adding a ASCII-art banner of "Scientific Calculator".

I made the 2nd peer review and worked on the project documentation.

Next week I'll work on implementing the sin, cos, min and max functions as well as custom variables. I will also work on the project documentation and make final adjustements before final return.

Time Spent: Approximately 4 hours
