# Week 3

This week I started implementing the shunting yard algorithm and wrote some basic tests for it. I researched the algorithm and how it works and how it can be implemented. The program is now able to convert infix notation to postfix notation in basic test cases (no functions) and is successfully detecting the operator precedence. There are still some validation missing for the input. The algorithm is however able to detect invalid parenthesis and raise an custom error.

Also added a verbose flag to the CLI in order to manually validate the output of the shunting yard algorithm.

Next week I will continue adding tests and more validation to the shunting yard algorithm and start implementing the postfix evaluation algorithm.

Time spent: Approximately 4 hours.
