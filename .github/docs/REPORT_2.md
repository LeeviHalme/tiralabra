# Week 2

This week I set up the project and installed the first dependencies with poetry. I also started to work on the project folder structure and set up other development tools such as pylint.

Added CI scripts with GitHub Actions that run the linter and unit tests on every push. The scripts can be found in the `.github/workflows` folder.

Two new data structures were implemented this week: `stack` and `queue`. Unit tests were written for both of them using the python's built-in unittest library and they were tested with pytest. The tests can be found in the `tests` folder.

Coverage was also added as a dependency and the GitHub repository was linked into Codecov. The Codecov project can be found [here](https://codecov.io/gh/LeeviHalme/tiralabra). The coverage report is generated automatically and is uploaded to Codecov by GitHub Actions.

Started to work on the implementation document and got that pretty much completed. The document can be found [here](/.github/docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md). Also started to work on the testing document and included a coverage graph from Codecov. The document can be found [here](/.github/docs/TESTING.md).

Time spent: Approximately 5 hours.
