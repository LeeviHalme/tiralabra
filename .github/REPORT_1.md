# Week 1

This week I familiarized myself with the course material and selected a topic for the project along with the programming language. I chose a scientific calculator that can evaluate mathematical statements written in infix-notation (natural notation). Most of the time this week went into researching about the algorithms and data structures related to the chosen topic, including the Shunting Yard algorithm, Reverse Polish Notation, infix vs. postfix notation, and the postfix evaluation.

I also created the project repository and registered it to Labtool. I created a Requirements Specification document that outlines the project scope.

Next week I will setup the Python project and all the necessary tools for testing and linting, including CI scripts and codecov. I will also start implementing the text-based user interface and the shunting yard algorithm.

## Questions

- Is the project scope suitable for the course?
